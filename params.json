The words must be one per line.\r\n2) Open Terminal and type:\r\n```\r\ncd ~/Desktop/vocab && ls\r\n```\r\nYou should see three files in the output (define.py words.txt and README.txt)\r\n\r\n3)  Type into terminal:\r\n```\r\npython define.py\r\n```\r\nThe program will prompt you to enter a file name.  This will be the output file, so name it anything besides \"words.\"  I like to name it: \"output.\"  \r\n\r\n4)  \r\n#IF THERE ARE NO ERRORS:  #\r\nOpen the output.txt (or whatever you named it) and you are done.\r\n\r\n# IF THERE ARE ERRORS: #\r\nYou need to install the following on your machine:  'Beautiful Soup' and 'requests' (and maybe 'lxml').
